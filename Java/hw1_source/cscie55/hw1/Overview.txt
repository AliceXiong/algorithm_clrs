Elevator.java\
I defined a Elevator class,which contains:\
	-enum Direction class with up and down;\
	-In order to track which floors passengers wanted to get off at, tracking array was created. Since we had 7 floors, so the length of tracking array was 8. The first element with index[0] does\'92t matter. All the other 7 elements was initialized as 0s. \
	-move(): Modifies the direction of travel, if the ground floor or top floor has been reached;\
	-boardPassenger(int floor): Adds to the Elevator a passenger destined for the indicated floor; So if we call boardPassenger(a), then it means in floor a, there will be one passenger want to get off. The tracking array will be updated correspondingly. \
	-toString(): Return number of passengers on board, and the current floor, and assist in debugging and testing.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 To demonstrate that your Elevator class is working properly, create an ElevatorTest class in the package\
	-Utilized the Elevator class created before and named it myElevator.\
	-Board two passengers for the 3rd floor, so myElevator.boardPassenger(3) has been called twice. \
	-print out passengers number in each floor.\
	-Elevator run from ground floor to the top floor, then back to the ground again for 2*NUMBFLOORS-1 = 13 times. \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
