The big change in homework 3 is the new Passenger object. Now instead of tracking counts of passengers in the waitQue[] and boardQue[] array. Three passenger collections are created in the Floor class. 
-	residentSet[], I chose HashSet as the collection type to store all the residents on that floor.  The residents are unsorted, they don’t need waiting in line for anything. 
-	goingUpSet[] and goingDownSet[], I chose ArrayList as the collection type to store all the passengers who are waiting in line. The reason why I picked up ArrayList was because, I could retrieve the passengers in the same order as they were added during the iterator. 

In the Elevator class, I created passengerSet collection to store all the passengers objects who were insider the elevator. 
-	passengerSet[], I chose HashSet as the collection type . All the passengers with the right destination floor will be disembarked when the elevator moves to the right floor. So they don’t require to be ordered (FIFO).
 
Since Elevator will call the building, and building will call the Floor, then Elevator.move() method can update those 4 collections of passengers correctly.
